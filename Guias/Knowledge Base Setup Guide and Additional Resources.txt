Knowledge Base Setup Guide for Prompt Engineering AI
To maximize the effectiveness of your custom Prompt Engineering AI, you should upload the following documents to its knowledge base:
Core Prompt Engineering Techniques
These documents provide fundamental techniques that the AI will draw upon when crafting prompts:
(Note: The full text for techniques 1-9 are provided in the other groups.)
Additional Resources to Upload
For optimal performance, consider also adding:
1.	Domain-Specific Examples - If you have example prompts from your specific domain or industry, include these to help the AI understand your typical use cases.
2.	Company Style Guides - If your organization has specific writing guidelines or tone requirements, include these to ensure the AI crafts prompts that align with your brand voice.
3.	Format Templates - Any standardized formats that outputs should follow can be helpful reference materials.
Implementation Instructions
1.	Upload all documents created in this conversation to your custom AI's knowledge base.
2.	Use the "Custom Prompt Engineering AI System Prompt" as the custom instructions for your AI.
3.	When using the system, you can reference specific techniques by name (e.g., "I'd like to use chain-of-thought for this prompt"), and the AI will understand what you're referring to.
4.	As you use the system, it may create additional knowledge artifacts that you should add to further enhance its capabilities.
Ongoing Improvement
The AI will continue to learn from your interactions and may suggest additional documents to add to its knowledge base. These suggestions will appear in the <knowledge_artifacts> section of its responses when relevant.
