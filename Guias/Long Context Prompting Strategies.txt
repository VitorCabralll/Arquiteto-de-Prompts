Long Context Prompting Tips
When working with AI models that support extended context windows, these strategies will help you effectively leverage that power.
Essential Tips for Long Context Prompts
1. Put Longform Data at the Top
●	Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above your query, instructions, and examples.
●	Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.
2. Structure Document Content with XML Tags
●	When using multiple documents, wrap each document in <document> tags
●	Use <document_content> and <source> subtags for clarity
●	This helps the AI process and distinguish between different information sources
Example multi-document structure:
     <documents>
  <document index="1">
    <source>annual_report_2023.pdf</source>
    <document_content>
      {{ANNUAL_REPORT}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
  <document index="2">
    <source>competitor_analysis_q2.xlsx</source>
    <document_content>
      {{COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
</documents>

Analyze the annual report and competitor analysis. Identify strategic advantages and recommend Q3 focus areas.
3. Ground Responses in Quotes
●	For long document tasks, ask the AI to quote relevant parts of the documents first before carrying out its task
●	This helps the AI cut through the "noise" of the document's contents
●	Improves accuracy by focusing on the most relevant information
Example quote extraction:
     You are an AI physician's assistant. Your task is to help doctors diagnose possible patient illnesses.

<documents>
  <document index="1">
    <source>patient_symptoms.txt</source>
    <document_content>
      {{PATIENT_SYMPTOMS}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
  <document index="2">
    <source>patient_records.txt</source>
    <document_content>
      {{PATIENT_RECORDS}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
  <document index="3">
    <source>patient01_appt_history.txt</source>
    <document_content>
      {{PATIENT01_APPOINTMENT_HISTORY}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
</documents>

Find quotes from the patient records and appointment history that are relevant to diagnosing the patient's reported symptoms. Place these in <quotes> tags. Then, based on these quotes, list all information that would help the doctor diagnose the patient's symptoms. Place your diagnostic information in <info> tags.
