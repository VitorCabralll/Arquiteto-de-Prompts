Mitigating Hallucinations and Ensuring Factual Grounding
AI models, while powerful, can sometimes "hallucinate" – generate plausible but incorrect or fabricated information. They might also try to provide an answer even when they lack sufficient information. To build more reliable and trustworthy AI applications, it's crucial to include instructions in your prompts that encourage factual accuracy and transparency about limitations.
Why Focus on Grounding and Accuracy?
●	Reliability: Ensures the AI's outputs are based on evidence rather than fabrication.
●	Trustworthiness: Builds user confidence when the AI can support its claims or acknowledge when it cannot.
●	Error Prevention: Reduces the risk of making decisions based on incorrect information provided by the AI.
Techniques for Prompting Accuracy:
Here are key instructions you can incorporate into your prompts, particularly when dealing with tasks requiring factual recall, analysis of provided information, or answering questions where certainty is important:
1.	Instruct the AI to Prioritize Information Review

○	Goal: Prevent the AI from jumping to conclusions before thoroughly analyzing the available information (either provided context or its internal knowledge).
○	How: Add explicit instructions at the beginning of the task description.
○	Example Instructions:
■	"Before answering the question, carefully review all the provided documents/context."
■	"First, analyze the data provided in <data> tags. Only then, proceed to identify the trends."
■	"Do not make assumptions beyond the information given. Base your response strictly on the provided text." (Useful for closed-context tasks)
■	If using tools: "First, use the search tool to find relevant information on [topic]. Then, summarize the key findings."
2.	Request Citations, Sources, or Evidence

○	Goal: Require the AI to back up its factual claims, making it easier to verify the information. This is particularly relevant when the AI has access to external documents, a knowledge base, or search tools.
○	How: Ask for specific references or links within the instructions.
○	Example Instructions:
■	"For any factual claims made, provide citations linking back to the relevant section of the provided documents."
■	"Include links to the sources used to support your answer."
■	"When extracting key points from the report, cite the page number or section for each point."
■	"Support your analysis with specific quotes or data points from the source material."
○	Note: Be aware that models might occasionally fabricate plausible-looking citations. Verification is still important, especially for critical applications.
3.	Instruct the AI to Acknowledge Uncertainty

○	Goal: Encourage the AI to explicitly state when it doesn't know something or cannot find supporting evidence, rather than guessing or fabricating an answer.
○	How: Include a specific instruction telling the AI how to handle uncertainty.
○	Example Instructions:
■	"If you cannot answer the question based on the provided information or your internal knowledge, state that clearly."
■	"If the provided documents do not contain the answer, respond with 'Information not found in the provided documents.'"
■	"If you are uncertain about a specific point or cannot find supporting facts, explicitly mention your uncertainty."
■	"Do not guess. If the information is unavailable, please indicate that."
Combining Techniques:
These techniques can often be used together effectively. For instance, when asking for a summary of research papers, you might instruct the AI to:
"Review the attached research papers <papers>{{PAPERS}}</papers>. First, identify the key findings related to [specific topic]. For each finding, provide a brief summary and cite the specific paper and section it came from. If a paper does not discuss [specific topic], state that clearly for that paper. If you cannot determine a specific detail with certainty based on the text, note your uncertainty."
